Use Azure Portal's "What's New":
Always check the announcement section in Azure ML studio

💡 Pro Tip: Use These Search Terms
When searching for Azure AI content, use these exact phrases:

"azure machine learning example scenario"

"azure architecture ai reference"

"site:learn.microsoft.com azure mlops production"

"azure openai enterprise deployment"

The key insight: Microsoft documentation changes frequently. Always start from the main service page (e.g., azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning) and navigate downward, rather than trying to find deep links directly.
